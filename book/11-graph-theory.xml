<text>

<title>Graphs</title>

<text>
[idea] A graph as a mathematical representation of a system composed of interconnected elements. Applications: human interactions, transportation systems, communication networks, electronic circuits... They can be used to represent any kind of relationship.
</text>

<text>
From a formal point of view, a graph G=(V,E) is a finite non-empty set V of vertices (or nodes) together with a possibly empty set E of pairs of V called edges (also known as links or ties). A graph G=(V,E) has a vertex set V and an edge set E, which are often denoted by V(G) and E(G), respectively.
</text>

<text>
Nodes correspond to the elements of the system represented by the graph, whereas links represent their connections. In a social network, for instance, people are nodes and friendship relationships are represented by links between pairs of nodes.
</text>

<text>
Graphs of order n (nodes) and size m (links): The number of vertices in the graph is the order of graph. The number of edges is the size of the graph. 
</text>


<text>
Edges {u,v} of G can be denoted by uv or vu. When uv is an edge in G, u and v are said to be adjacent vertices and they are referred to as neighbors of each other. Likewise, when uv and vw are distinct edges in G, they are said to be adjacent edges.
</text>

<text>
[idea] dyadic (pairwise) relationships
</text>

<text>
++ Directed graphs (= digraphs): undirected graphs for nondirectional links, directed graphs for directional links.

Examples: road networks (lanes in both directions) are undirected vs. street networks within cities (typically directed due to one-way streets; program flow graphs are typically directed (dependences)...
</text>

<text>
++ Binary vs. weighted graphs: binary graphs for dichotomous links (ties are either present or absent for each pair of nodes), weighted graphs for valued links (that indicate the strength, intensity, or frequency of the tie between each pair of actors). Binary graphs, also known as unweighted graphs...

- Each edge is assigned a numerical value or weigth; e.g. road network (length, traversal time, construction cost, speed limit...)
</text>


<text>
A self-loop, or loop for short, is an edge from one vertex to itself
</text>

<text>
++ Multigraphs/pseudographs: An edge is a multiedge when it appears more than once in the same graph. 
</text>

<text>
A graph without multiedges nor self-loops is called a simple graph. Multiedges and self-loops introduce some subtetlies in the design of graph algorithms, hence simple graphs are often preferred.
</text>


<text>
++ Labeled graphs: Each vertex is assigned a name or identifier (may not be unique). Note: the index of a node within the graph is often employed as a surrogate for the node identifier (for convenience when implementing efficient algorithms and also for preserving anonymity in some applications).
</text>

<text>
++ Attribute graphs @ attributes at nodes and edges
</text>

<tag>graph-theory-degree</tag>
<title>Node degrees and degree sequences</title>

<text>
The set of neighbors of a vertex v is the neighborhood of v and is denoted by <eqn>N_G(v)</eqn>. Technically, that is the open neighborhood of the vertex (the closed neighborhood would also include the vertex v). The degree of a vertex v in a graph G is the number of vertices in G that are adjacent to v, i.e. <eqn>deg_G(v) = |N_G(v)|</eqn>. The minimum degree among the vertices of G is denoted by <eqn>\delta(G)</eqn>, while the maximum degree in G is denoted by <eqn>\Delta(G)</eqn>. Hence, <eqn>0 \le \delta(G) \le deg_G(v) \le \Delta(G) \le n-1</eqn>.
</text>

<text>
The average degree of a graph G of order n and size m is 2m/n, a result we obtain if we take into account that the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the graph is 2m (the First Theorem of Graph Theory, a.k.a. the Handshaking Lemma <cite>Chartrand et al. 2011</cite>).
</text>


<text>
++ Weighted graphs: Node strength instead of node degree = Sum of all the edge weights of a node.
</text>

<text>
++ Degree sequence

An integer partition p = (p_1, ..., p_n) where p_i is the degree of the ith highest-degree node in the graph.

p is an integer partition of 2m, i.e. sum p_i = 2m, in undirected graphs, since each edge contributes to the degree of two nodes.

Not all integer partitions correspond to actual graphs.

An algorithm to build a graph given a degree sequence: the highest-degree node is connected to the following node; the degree sequence is updated by decrementing p_1 and p_2 (and reorder the partition), resulting in a smaller partition; the process is repeated until the degree sequence is full of zeroes (or a negative value appears, which means the graph was not realizable).

The algorithm above is deterministic. If we want a random graphs with the given degree sequence, we can generate them by flipping edges: from (x,y) and (w,z) we create (x,w) and (y,z), which yields a different graph with the same degree sequence (albeit it should be noted that the resulting graph is not necessarily connected).

<title>Connectivity, paths, and distance</title>


<text>
Graphs are sparse when existing edges represent a small fraction of the possible vertex pairs. They are dense when there are edges between most vertex pairs. Dense graphs typically have a quadratic number of edges, whereas sparse graphs are linear in size. The application domain often imposes limits of the number of edges that are incident on any given node within the graph, hence most real-world graphs are actually sparse.
</text>

<text>
Planar graphs, i.e. those that can be drawn on a plane without link crossings, are common in many applications. They are always sparse, since they have at most 2n-6 links. Trees, for instance, are also planar graphs.
</text>

<text>
++ Connected graphs, weakly-connected vs. strongly-connected components (a.k.a. blocks)

A graph G is strongly connected if all nodes in G can reach v and are reachable from v.

Weakly-connected and strongly-connected components define unique partitions of the graph nodes.
</text>

<text>
In binary graphs, path lengths correspond to the number of edges paths contain, whereas they are computed using edge weights in weighted graphs (paths composed of stronger edges span shorter lengths).
</text>

<text>
++ Walks, trails, and paths
</text>

<text>
++ Circuits and cycles: Acyclic graphs do not contain any cycles.
</text>

<text>
Paths and cycles are important kinds of graphs. A path <eqn>P_n</eqn> is a graph of order n and size n-1 whose vertices can be labeled <eqn>v_1, v_2, ..., v_n</eqn> and whose edges are <eqn>v_iv_{i+1}</eqn> for <eqn>i=1,2,...,n-1</eqn>. A cycle <eqn>C_n</eqn> is a graph of order n and size n whose whose vertices can be labeled <eqn>v_1, v_2, ..., v_n</eqn> and whose edges are <eqn>v_1v_n</eqn> and <eqn>v_iv_{i+1}</eqn> for <eqn>i=1,2,...,n-1</eqn>. The cycle <eqn>C_3</eqn> is called a triangle.
</text>

<text>
Eulerian cycle (tour visiting every edge)
- An undirected graph contains an Eulerian cycle iff (1) it is connected, and (2) each vertex is of even degree.
- An undirected graph contains an Eulerian path iff (1) it is connected, and (2) all but two vertices are of even degree. These two vertices will be the start and end points of any path.

- A directed graph contains an Eulerian cycle iff (1) it is strongly-connected, and (2) each vertex has the same in-degree as out-degree.
- A directed graph contains an Eulerian path from x to y iff (1) it is connected, and (2) all other vertices have the same in-degree as out-degree,
with x and y being vertices with in-degree one less and one more than their out-degrees, respectively.
</text>


<text>
++ Distance, geodesic, eccentricity, diameter, radius

The eccentricity of vertex v in a graph is the shortest-path distance to the farthest vertex from v. 
The radius of a graph is the smallest eccentricity of any vertex.
The diameter of a graph is the maximum eccentricity of any vertex.
The center is the set of vertices whose eccentricity is the radius.

</text>

<text>
An edge linking two nodes indicates that they can communicate directly, whereas longer paths are likely to have a lower effect on the network behavior.
</text>

<text>
++ Counting the number of paths of length k by matrix multiplication: A^k (includes non-simple paths), e.g. divide-and-conquer algorithm @ Skiena 425 [Karatsuba KO63], fast multiplication algorithms @ Skiena 403 [Strassen 69][Coppersmith 90][CKSU05]

<text>
The pairwise distance of the shortest path linking the nodes in a network is represented in its distance matrix. Its global maximum is the network diameter. The distance matrix describes the communication pattern within the network.

<text>
In a complete graph, every two distinct edges are adjacent, i.e. the size of a complete graph of order n is n(n-1)/2. The complete graph of order n is denoted by <eqn>K_n</eqn>. ++ tournament (orientation of a complete graph)
</text>

<text>
++ Regular graphs, e.g. cubic graphs, Petersen graphs:

i.e. all nodes have the same degree
</text>

<text>
++ Grids
</text>

<text>
++ Bipartite graphs
</text>

<text>
++ Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a.k.a. partial orders or posets, arise in some applications, e.g. scheduling
+ Topological sorting orders the vertices of a DAG respecting the precedence constraints imposed by the arcs in the DAG.

connected graph with n-1 edges and n nodes
</text>

<text>
Trees are recursive structures, since cutting any edge leaves two smaller trees.
</text>

<text>
++ Special trees: stars, double stars, and caterpillars (spine)
</text>

<text>
++ Prüfer codes (parents) [Prü 1918]

+ The degree of a node is one more than the number of times its value appears in the Prüfer sequence

a simple way to rank and unrank labeled trees and solve any tree generation problem: Exactly n^(n-2) labeled trees on n vertices, which correspond to that many strings of length n-2 on the alphabet {1..n}.

NOTE: There are two models for generating data such as permutations: ranking/unranking (biyective function) and incremental change methods (iterators). Ranking/unranking methods make it trivial to generate random data (just generate a random number and rank), whereas enumeration by incremental change methods makes it tricky to generate random data (e.g. needed to solve some hard problems using randomized algorithms)

e.g. permutations [Knuth05a]

INCORRECT (does not generate permutations uniformly!) 

for i=1..n 
  a[i] = i

for j=1..n-1
  swap( a[i], a[random(1,n)]

CORRECT VERSION

for i=1..n 
  a[i] = i

for j=1..n-1
  swap( a[i], a[random(i,n)]

Origin of graph theory: Euler founded the field he called <q>geometria situs</q> (geometry of position), what is now known as graph theory.
</text>

</text>

<text>
<q>In addition to that branch of geometry which is concerned with magnitudes, and
which has always received the greatest attention, there is another branch, pre-
viously almost unknown, which Leibniz first mentioned, calling it the geometry
of position. This branch is concerned only with the determination of position
and its properties; it does not involve measurements, nor calculations made
with them. It has not yet been satisfactorily determined what kind of problems
are relevant to this geometry of position, or what methods should be used in
solving them. Hence, when a problem was recently mentioned, which seemed
geometrical but was so constructed that it did not require the measurement of
distances, nor did calculation help at all, I had no doubt that it was concerned
with the geometry of position - especially as its solution involved only position,
and no calculation was of any use...</q> translated from <q>Solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position</q> <cite>Euler 1736</cite>

<text>
[Wikipedia] In 1736 Euler solved, or rather proved unsolvable, a problem known as the seven bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Kingdom of Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The question is whether it is possible to walk with a route that crosses each bridge exactly once, and return to the starting point. Euler's solution of the Königsberg bridge problem is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory. In addition, his recognition that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints (rather than their exact positions) presaged the development of topology <cite>Alexanderson 2006</cite>.
This stamp of the former German Democratic Republic honoring Euler displaying his formula relating the number of faces, edges and vertices of a convex polyhedron. Euler also made contributions to the understanding of planar graphs. He introduced a formula governing the relationship between the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a convex polyhedron. Given such a polyhedron, the alternating sum of vertices, edges and faces equals a constant: V-E+F=2.

The term graph was not used in its current sense until 1878, when J.J. Sylvester used it instead of <q>linkage</q>, which was the term used to refer to graphs at that time <cite>Gross and Yellen 2003</cite>.
