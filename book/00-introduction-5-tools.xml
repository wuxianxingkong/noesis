Abstract: Graphs appear in numerous applications including cyber-security, the Internet, social networks, protein networks, recommendation systems, and many more. Graphs with millions or even billions of nodes and edges are common-place. How to store such large graphs efficiently? What are the core operations/queries on those graph? How to answer the graph queries quickly? We propose GBASE, a scalable and general graph management and mining system. The key novelties lie in 1) our storage and compression scheme for a parallel setting and 2) the carefully chosen graph operations and their efficient implementation. We designed and implemented an instance of GBASE using MapReduce/Hadoop. GBASE provides a parallel indexing mechanism for graph mining operations that both saves storage space, as well as accelerates queries. We ran numerous experiments on real graphs, spanning billions of nodes and edges, and we show that our proposed GBASE is indeed fast, scalable and nimble, with significant savings in space and time.

Twitter today open-sourced the code that it used to build its database of users and manage their relationships to one another, called FlockDB. The move comes shortly after Twitter released its Gizzard framework, which it uses to query the FlockDB distributed data store up to 10,000 times a second without creating a logja

- Vertex-centric model
i.e. BSP Computational model http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_synchronous_parallel
i.e. makes calculating data for each vertex and edge in parallel possible on a cluster of nodes

 BSP (Bulk Synchronous Processing) model. In this model, there are multiple processing units proceeding in parallel in a sequence of “supersteps”. Within each “superstep”, each processing units first receive all messages delivered to them from the preceding “superstep”, and then manipulate their local data and may queue up the message that it intends to send to other processing units. This happens asynchronously and simultaneously among all processing units. The queued up message will be delivered to the destined processing units but won’t be seen until the next “superstep”. When all the processing unit finishes the message delivery (hence the synchronization point), the next superstep can be started, and the cycle repeats until the termination condition has been reached.


PREGEL
While it sounds similar to mapreduce, Pregel is optimized for graph operations, by reducing I/O, ensuring data locality, but also preserving processing state between phases.
http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/841789848/comparing-pregel-and-mapreduce

  Since Pregel model retain worker state (the same worker is responsible for the same set of nodes) across iteration, the graph can be loaded in memory once and reuse across iterations. This will reduce I/O overhead as there is no need to read and write to disk at each iteration. For fault resilience, there will be a periodic check point where every worker write their in-memory state to disk.

  SIGMOD'2010 paper <cite>Malewicz et al. 2010</cite>: we present a computational model suitable for this task. Programs are expressed as a sequence of iterations, in each of which a vertex can receive messages sent in the previous iteration, send messages to other vertices, and modify its own state and that of its outgoing edges or mutate graph topology. This vertex-centric approach is flexible enough to express a broad set of algorithms. The model has been designed for efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant implementation on clusters of thousands of commodity computers, and its implied synchronicity makes reasoning about programs easier. Distribution-related details are hidden behind an abstract API. The result is a framework for processing large graphs that is expressive and easy to program.

Also, Pregel (with its stateful characteristic), only send local computed result (but not the graph structure) over the network, which implies the minimal bandwidth consumption.

GraphChi runs vertex-centric programs asynchronously (i.e changes written to edges are immediately visible to subsequent computation), and in parallel. GraphChi also supports streaming graph updates and changing the graph structure while computing.
